This repository is a culmination of work I will be doing for my __Data Analysis Course!__

This is my __first ever__ markdown document!

I am brand new to any type of coding, and am an undergraduate Psychology student attending USF

Now for __5 DIFFERENT__ functionalities 

# 1: Headers are FUN

Headers can have **4 different sizes** which can be applied by using **more or less hashtags** at the start of a line

#### This is h4 for example, not too large!

# 2: Images

As a USF student, it would be rude of me not to include a piece of my school.

Along with a picture of one of my many cats, Pebbles

It is very simple to add images to a markdown! View in my raw code!

# 3: Lists

* Lists are also very simple
  + Sub categories are also easy to integrate
  
1. It can be important
+ to organize
  
2. And number lists
+ from time to time
    
# 4: TABLES
|Cat  |Dog  |
|:----|:----|
|Good!|Bad! |

This is not a hate crime towards any dog, just a statistical acknowledgement that cats are superior

# 5: Block Quotes

> When you need to use block quotes, they are avaliable! It looks pretty cool!
